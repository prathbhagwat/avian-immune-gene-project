# Project Title

## Short description of the dataset

[Provide a brief, high-level overview of the dataset. What kind of data is it? What is its primary purpose or subject?]

[Insert Link to Carolineâ€™s project here]

This dataset is based on or derived from the work done in Caroline's project. Please refer to the original source for more comprehensive details and context.

## Description of simulated infection metadata

[Explain the simulated infection metadata. What variables are included? What do they represent? How was this metadata generated or what does it simulate?]

Key metadata fields might include:
*   `patient_id`: Unique identifier for each simulated patient.
*   `infection_status`: (e.g., infected, not_infected, recovered)
*   `time_point`: (e.g., day_0, day_1, day_7 post-infection)
*   `treatment_group`: (e.g., placebo, drug_a, drug_b)
*   ... [add other relevant metadata fields]

## Gene Expression Data (`gene_expression_data.csv`)

The `gene_expression_data.csv` file contains gene expression levels for the simulated subjects.

**File Description:**
[Describe the structure of the CSV. Are genes in rows or columns? What do the values represent (e.g., normalized counts, TPMs)?]

**Example Rows:**

```csv
gene_id,sample1_expression,sample2_expression,sample3_expression
GENE_A,10.5,12.1,9.8
GENE_B,0.5,1.2,0.9
GENE_C,200.3,250.7,220.1
...
```

*(Alternatively, if the file is very large, you can describe the columns instead of showing example rows)*

**Column Descriptions (if not showing example rows):**
*   `gene_id`: Identifier for the gene.
*   `sample_X_expression`: Expression value for a given sample.
